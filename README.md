1. Description.

A little code demonstrating Huffman algorithm. Huffman coding assigns codes to characters such that the length of the code depends on the relative frequency or weight of the corresponding character. 


2. Installation.

On Linux compile the software using "make". 

3. Using.

You can enter a maximum of 255 characters in the buffer for encoding. The program will build a tree and display the ASCII data and the new character encoding, as well as the frequency table. All this is intended to demonstrate the result of the algorithm.
