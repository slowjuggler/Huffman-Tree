1. Description.

A little code demonstrating Huffman algorithm. Huffman coding assigns codes to characters such that the length of the code depends on the relative frequency or weight of the corresponding character. Huffman codes are of variable-length, and prefix-free (no code is prefix of any other). Any prefix-free binary code can be visualized as a binary tree with the encoded characters stored at the leaves. A Huffman coding tree or Huffman tree is a full binary tree in which each leaf of the tree corresponds to a letter in the given alphabet. 


2. Installation.

On Linux compile the software using "make".
